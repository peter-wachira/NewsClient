# NewsApp
This is my simple app demonstration the use of clean architecture. It gets data from the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) and entertains the user using
clean architecture and MVVM.

## Prerequisite

minSdkVersion -> 26

Gradle build system


## Set up project

Head over to the News api above and get your own API-KEY as well.

To add the News API key, go to your gradle.properties file, then add this line: 

```MY_KEY="b7122b5c5f8948eda9715867b6240ce6"```

Run the project. :)

## Architecture

### Implemented using Clean Architecture
The following diagram shows the structure of this project with 3 layers:
- Presentation
- Domain
- Data

</p>
<br>

### Communication between layers

1. UI calls method from ViewModel.
2. ViewModel executes Use case.
3. Each Repository returns data from a Data Source (Cached or Remote).
4. Information flows back to the UI where we display the list of posts.




The App is not organized into multiple modules but follows the same principles of
the Presentation, Domain, and Data Layers.
The presentation layer handles the UI work with the logic contained in the **ViewModel**.
The UI uses a **LiveData** object from the ViewModel and observes it using the **Observer Pattern**.
A ListAdapter handles the actual displaying of the news. Data over the network is retrieved using
**retrofit** and **coroutines** to handle background work asynchronously. Additionally, note that
the ViewModel uses the **viewModelScope** to launch the coroutines while Fragments use the **viewLifeCycleOwner**
to observe data.
The data layer uses the recommended **Repository Pattern** to make the network calls and store the data using
**Room DB**.


## APK

Link to APK file [APK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13s8Y3qZtsgUET6sStKSO9eXaKiJnpl-7/view?usp=sharing ) 

## Flow

 **Landing screen**

  Once the app is launched, the user has the option of choosing where to navigate within the app.

 **Search Screen**

 This screen is accessible from all the screens and allows the user to search for news articles.
 
## Libraries

This app will make use of the following libraries:

## Extras


#### CI-Pipeline

[Github Actions CI](https://github.com/features/actions/) is used for Continuous Integration every time an update is made
to the repo. The configuration is in the .develop.yml .master.yml .branch.yml*** files

#### Code Analysis and test coverage

This code uses [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) for analysing the quality of the code, which is
always going to be A :)
